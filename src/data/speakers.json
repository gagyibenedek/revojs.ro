    "abstract": "WebAssembly is a new programming language, allowing us to compile C/C++ or other statically typed languages and run them in the browser and Node.js. While languages like C/C++ support multi-threading, JavaScript is single-threaded and this raises the question of how WebAssembly will behave. In this talk we will discuss the design of threads for WebAssembly, the implementation challenges in terms of security and we will see examples of how multithreading can be achieved using Web Workers."

Whether you want to find your hotel, plan your next hike or see the results of a recent election: maps are indispensable.</p> <p>But how do we create such maps? Web mapping APIs have come a long way. They are easy to use and not only allow you to create 2D maps, but more recently also 3D ones. Add some magic geo data and cartographic knowledge and you are on your way to build your first mapping master piece.</p> <p>In this talk we’ll go through the process of creating a web map: Starting from an idea, gathering and processing the data, and finishing up with a beautiful web map visualization. No geo-knowledge required! Enthusiasm for maps will be provided in the beginning of the talk.</p>"
